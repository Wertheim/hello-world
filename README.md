Misc.
This is where I commit misc. code snippets/excercises that I practice on.

I am currently teaching a class on Python and JavaScript.
There are 3 examples of code in this repository:

Interest(bisection).py--
  Calculates the best savings rate needed to save for 36 months and afford 
  a down payment on a home based of your annual income.  It uses a bi-section search to
  cut down on the number of guesses needed
  
Permutations(Recursive).py--
  Takes a word and recursively prints all the different combinations of the letters
  
Sorting Practice.py--
  Three popular sorting algorithms redone in python.
  Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort.
  Note Bubble and Selection will mutate the original list
  
Format.py--
  This program was made to pull out only the student ID's from one excel sheet, that were contained in a different excel sheet. 
  (Including duplicates) It writes to a text file a specific cell from an excel sheet, if 2 cells (first name and last name) are included
  in a different excel sheet.  I used this to create a database of student who were in our lunch system so we could use a barcode scanner
  on their physical ID's instead of looking them up by hand.
  TODO: write directly to excel file
  
Added Wertheim.html
  A resume coded in html/css
Please let me know if you would like other/more relevant examples to something in particular
