Misc.
This is where I commit misc. code snippets/excercises that I practice on.

I am currently teaching a class on Python and JavaScript
There are 3 examples of code in this repository:

Interest(bisection).py
  Calculates the best savings rate needed to save for 36 months and afford 
  a down payment on a home based of your annual income.  It uses a bi-section search to
  cut down on the number of guesses needed
  
Permutations(Recursive).py
  Takes a word and recursively prints all the different combinations of the letters
  
Sorting Practice.py
  Three popular sorting algorithms redone in python.
  Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort.
  Note Bubble and Selection will mutate the original list
  
Please let me know if you would like other/more relevant examples to something in particular
